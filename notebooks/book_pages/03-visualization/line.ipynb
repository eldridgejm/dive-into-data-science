    "Consider the plot above. The default behavior of pandas is to choose the scale of the y-axis so as to minimize empty space. In this case, the default axis ranges from 49 degrees to about 55 degrees. As a consequence, the line is more than *twice* as high in 2010 as it was in 1900. Of course, this doesn't mean that the temperature is twice as high as it was in 1900! Still, if our goal was to make the change in temperature appear as large as possible, this would be the scale we would use.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we wished to *downplay* the change in temperature over the last century, we might change the y-axis so that it starts at zero and ends at 100. This \"fixes\" the issue with the line doubling in height, but it has the effect of obscuring the warming trend. We can see this by re-creating the plot above, this time with `ylim=(0, 100)`, which makes the lower and upper limits of the y-axis 0 degrees and 100 degrees, respectively."
