Does it tend to rain more when it is warm? If there is an association between these variables, the scatter plot will make it very clear."

We then decide on which variable should be called the \"x\" variable and which should be called the \"y\" variable; sometimes there is no natural reason to prefer one over the other, so we make an arbitrary choice. We then create a plot by making a single dot for each individual in our data set, using the \"x\" variable as the dot's x-coordinate, and the \"y\" variable as the dot's y-coordinate."

First, we can make the plot larger using the `figsize=(<width>, <height>)` keyword argument. Second, we can make each dot slightly transparent using the `alpha=<opacity>` keyword argument, where the opacity should be a number between 0 (completely see-through) and 1 (opaque).
