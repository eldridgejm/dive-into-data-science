    "- To get multiple pieces of data in one place, we create a **collection**. If the collection is ordered then it is a **sequence**.\n",
    "- Each item in a sequence has an **index** -- its position, starting at zero.\n",
    "- **Lists** are the most basic sequence, and are created by surrounding a group of items with square brackets and separating each item by commas: `[item, item, ...]`\n",
    "- **Arrays** are a sequence type from the NumPy library, and are created by passing a list into the `np.array` function: `np.array([item, item, ...])` `np.array(my_list)`\n",
    "- NumPy offers lots of additional functions that can be called on sequences. These can be accessed using `np.function_name(arguments, ...)`.\n",
    "- An item can be selected from an array by using brackets with the index of the item: `my_array[index]`\n",
    "- Arrays support **element-wise operations**, such as adding or multiplying all elements by a single number.\n",
    "- Arrays of the same length support paired element-wise operations between the two arrays, such as adding or multiplying each element in one array with each element in the same position of another array.\n",
    "- An array of numbers with constant spacing can be easily constructed using `np.arange`\n",
    "- A range will always *exclude* the endpoint -- so `np.arange(3)` will count `0 1 2`."
