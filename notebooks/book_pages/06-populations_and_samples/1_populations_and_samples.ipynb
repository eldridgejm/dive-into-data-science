    "#### Why do sample distributions resemble their population?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we take a representative sample, we are picking individuals at random from the population. Recall that when more individuals share a similar value of a feature, the population distribution is considered 'denser' at that value.\n",

    "![](population-distribution.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we randomly pick an individual, we're more likely to pick individuals from denser regions (higher bars) since there are physically more individuals in our population that exist in that range of values. The opposite can be said for regions of low density (lower bars) -- if there's a low density, we're less likely to pick an individual there.\n",

    "![](population-samples.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, once we've taken our full sample and plot out the sample distribution, we the sample will also exhibit more individuals from the same dense regions, and fewer individuals from the same low density regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](sample-distribution.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Invariably, there is random chance involved during sampling, so in most cases we won't produce a sample distribution that is exactly the same as the population. Each sample looks a bit different from the population and from each other, but greater disparities have rarer probabilities. It's downright statistically *unlikely* that we could produce a large sample distribution that looks super different from our population distribution."
