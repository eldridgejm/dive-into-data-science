    "## Models versus Reality\n",
    "\n",
    "In our examination of populations, we were introduced to *models* -- sets of assumptions about what a population distribution looks like. We assumed that the distribution of U.S. birthdays fit a uniform model ![](birthday-model.png), but when we took a sample it looked a bit different than uniform ![](birthday-sample.png). It doesn't look *too* different though, right? Or does it? At what point does that sample distribution look so different from our model population that we choose to abandon the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "This teetering act between belief in a model versus the reality contained in a sample (albeit subject to random chance) is a tough but common problem present far beyond just statistics classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Swain v. Alabama\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. judicial system operates with a constitutional right that potential jurors for a court case are drawn representatively from the local population. We can think of the constitutional right as establishing a model that the jury pool is drawn randomly from the population of eligible jurors in the county.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tragically, this model is often a fiction, as the 1965 case of Robert Swain vs. Alabama shows. As a Black man, Swain was convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death. Swain's conviction cannot be interpreted without considering the numerous instances in which the American criminal justice system has been deliberately and maliciously used as a weapon to inflict violence upon innocent Black Americans -- all under legal pretenses. Swain's plight brings to mind the disturbing cases of the [Groveland Four](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/11/684540515/accused-of-florida-rape-70-years-ago-4-black-men-get-posthumous-pardons) and the [Scottsboro Boys](https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog/scottsboro-boys) in which Black men and boys were falsely accused and subsequently imprisoned, sentenced to death, or murdered.\n",
    "In all three cases, defendents were tried by all-white juries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Swain appealed his conviction by arguing that the all-white jury in his trial was chosen unconstitutionally.\n",
    "Of the $100$ potential jurors pooled, only $8$ ($8\\%$) were Black -- a sizable deviation from the $26\\%$ of eligible Black jurors in the county. This case was soon elevated to the U.S. Supreme Court, Swain v. Alabama. The Supreme Court eventually denied the appeal and the claim of bias, concluding that the disparity between the demographics of the greater population and the jury was \"small\" and \"reflects no studied attempt\" to exclude Black people from the jury -- in other words, the court said the all-white jury was due to chance. This explanation might strike you as unlikely -- in fact, as the analyses of this section will show, the chance of seeing such a biased jury panel by pure chance is effectively zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Swain's appeal is an important example of the grave consequences that can result from an inability to reason about uncertainty. In the most optimistic view, the Supreme Court's decision came simply from ignorance of basic probability and statistics. In this light, had they even minimal training in reasoning about randomness, their decision would have been different and Swain's conviction would have been overturned. But in a less charitable  view, the Supreme Court knowingly upheld a racist system by using random chance as an excuse. In this sense, the court exploited the public's lack of experience in reasoning about uncertainty in order to perpetuate and legitimize a racist system. \n",
    "\n",
    "A populace armed with the ability to reason about uncertaintly is not easily swayed by defenses of racism that attribute injustic to random chance. With that in mind, we now turn to the task of showing how the Supreme Court's decision can be refuted with a simple statistical argument."

    "The cutoff for when a p-value is considered small enough to reject the null should be set ahead of time -- before the test is conducted. This threshold is generally referred to as the {dterm}`level of significance`, denoted $\\alpha$, and its value should be chosen depending on conventions, tolerance of risk (what if your test is wrong!?), and even your personal belief about how random the universe is.\n",

    "When you set the level of significance, you're essentially saying:  \n",

    "\n",
    "In the history of hypothesis testing setting this value has been somewhat of a touchy-subject, and has sparked great controversy! If you've ever seen a hypothesis test before this point, you've likely seen the phrase \"$p < \\alpha = 0.05$\" as the justification that the results of some paper are significant since they were able to quash the prior beliefs of the null. Why is $0.05$ used so commonly, though? Simply because it is popular.\n",

    "Remember, if we set $\\alpha=0.05$ then we'll choose abandon an entire set of beliefs just because we observed something that had a less-than $5\\%$ chance of occurring. What if the null is actually true, though? Then $5\\%$ of the time that we run our test we might randomly make an observation worth of incorrectly rejecting the null -- that's could be a one-in-twenty event!\n",

    "The level of significance is directly linked with the chance that we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis when in fact it is true. A \"false positive\" such as this could lead to disastrous effects depending on your field, which is why many fields like medicine choose much more stringent levels of significance, like $\\alpha=0.001$."

    "The hypothesis testing framework work we've discovered really works great on lots of different things you throw at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize this framework, we:\n",
    "1. Observe a sample and statistic\n",
    "2. Formulate a null hypothesis about the underlying population and parameter, and set a level of significance\n",
    "3. Formulate an alternative hypothesis\n",
    "4. Generate new test statistics under the assumptions of the null\n",
    "5. Calculate the probability of a test statistic being as extreme as the observed statistic\n",
    "6. Make a judgment about the null hypothesis using the p-value and level of significance\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this approach towards hypothesis testing handles many different things we throw at it. We can run tests on continuous data or discrete data and it doesn't matter what the true population looks like just as long as we're able to generate a statistic. We can test using practically *any* statistic we choose, such as a mean, max, variance, or even count.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework is so incredibly flexible because it follows a simple, intuitive principle: *if we have a set of assumptions, then we better expect data generated from those assumptions to look like what we observed in real life.* We now have a solid way to quantify the degree to which an observation challenges a set of assumptions."
