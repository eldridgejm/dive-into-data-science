We assumed that the distribution of U.S. birthdays fit a uniform model ![](birthday-model.png), but when we took a sample it looked a bit different than uniform ![](birthday-sample.png). It doesn't look *too* different though, right? Or does it? At what point does that sample distribution look so different from our model population that we choose to abandon the model?\n",

(In U.S. courts, a pool of potential jurors is first drawn from the population fairly, and then the final jurors are selected manually by the involved parties).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of the constitutional right as establishing a model that the jury pool is drawn from the population of eligible jurors in the county.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Alabama 1964, this model was called into question by Robert Swain. As a black man, Swain was convicted by an all white jury, and sentenced to death. While appealing his sentence, Swain argued that the jury pool was not representative of his peers. Of the $100$ potential jurors pooled, only $8$ ($8\\%$) were black -- a sizable deviation from the $26\\%$ of eligible black jurors in the county. This case was soon elevated to the U.S. Supreme Court, *Swain v. Alabama*, calling into question the existence of bias in the jury pooling process. The Supreme Court eventually denied the appeal and the claim of bias. But should they have?\n",
