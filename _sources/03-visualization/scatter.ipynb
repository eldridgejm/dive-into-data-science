We then decide on which variable should be called the \"x\" variable and which should be called the \"y\" variable; sometimes there is no natural reason to prefer one over the other, so we make an arbitrary choice. We then create a plot by making a single dot for each individual in our data set, using the \"x\" variable as the dot's x-coordinate, and the \"y\" variable as the dot's y-coordinate."

First, we can make the plot larger using the `figsize=(<width>, <height>)` keyword argument. Second, we can make each dot slightly transparent using the `alpha=<opacity>` keyword argument, where the opacity should be a number between 0 (completely see-through) and 1 (opaque).
