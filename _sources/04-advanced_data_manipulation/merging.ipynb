    "We often find the need to work with data from multiple tables, even when that data is about the same topic! For example, both our wildfire data and our climate data had rows about 2019, or in a separate setting a store might keep track of their sales in one table but keep info on each item sold in a separate table. In either case, we'll likely find it useful to combine the tables and put the data in one place so that we can conduct our analysis. This is called 'merging' or 'joining'.\n",
