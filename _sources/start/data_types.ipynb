    "- **Integers** `int` are whole numbers\n",
    "- **Floats** `float` are numbers with decimals\n",
    "- **Strings** `str` are text\n",
    "- **Booleans** `bool` are True/False\n",

    "Multiple strings can be glued together using `+`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings own a handful of **methods** -- functions that belong solely to the data type of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are called using **dot notation**, by placing a dot after a string or variable name of a string, then calling the function: `my_string.function_name(arguments, ...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Some string methods allow you to create new strings that change capitalization or find and replace snippets of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of objects can be compared using **comparison operators**, `<` `<=` `>` `>=` `==` `!=`, which will return a boolean value.\n",

    "Trying to perform an operation on data types that don't support that operation will often result in a **TypeError**.\n",
