Before we do, it might interest you to know that most of the pages in this textbook were actually written as Jupyter notebooks -- including this page! In fact, you can see the notebook version of this page by hovering over the rocket icon above and selecting \"JupyterHub\". This will open the current page as a notebook on JupyterHub. Feel free to experiment by changing the notebook's code cells and running them. Don't worry: the changes will only appear in your notebook, and won't affect the textbook.\n",
