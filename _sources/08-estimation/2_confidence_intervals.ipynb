    "- The 50th percentile is generally the median -- half of the data is below the median, and half is above\n",
    "    - The only difference is that during the median you might average the two center values, whereas with the 50th percentile you would just choose the higher value\n",
    "- The 100th percentile is the maximum -- all data is below this value\n",
    "- The 25th and 75th percentiles are also called the first and third 'quartiles' -- coupled coupled with the median (second quartile) these essentially split our data into four bins containing equal amounts of data\n",
